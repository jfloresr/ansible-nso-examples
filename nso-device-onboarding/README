# nso-device-onboarding
This playbook can be used to onboard devices into NSO. It will create an authgroup, add it to NSO, fetch SSH keys and perform a sync-from.

This playbook assumes that the device will be using SSH and the Cisco IOS NED for now.

Future enhancements:

- Add more capability to support other devices (namespaces make it tricky).
